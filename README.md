# SQL-Blood-Donation-Mgmnt

This is a Blood Management System . 
The SQL code for the Blood Donation Management System creates a database with four key tables: Donor, Donation, BloodInventory, and Request. 
This has been ceated in MySQL.
The Donor table stores personal details of blood donors, while the Donation table records each blood donation made, including the donor ID, date, and amount donated.
The BloodInventory table keeps track of available blood stock by blood group and volume, while the Request table manages blood requests from hospitals or clinics, including request details and status. 
Sample data is inserted into these tables for demonstration purposes. 
Key queries include fetching donors by blood group, updating inventory after donations, fulfilling blood requests, listing pending requests, and displaying a specific donor's donation history.
This system can be expanded further with features like triggers, stored procedures, and front-end integration for better functionality and management.
